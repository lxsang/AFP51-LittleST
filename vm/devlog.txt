TO FIX
	replace object free list by a dictionary, so that an object can have unlimited size (byte array, string, etc.)
	crash when compile error
	extern allocation size : allocation bigger than permitted
	#define FREELISTMAX 2000 -> 4000
	extern string buffer size
	modify size field to int of object struct
	
Memory allocation problem when allocating a block greater than 6000 (define as default), find an efficient way to resolve it
