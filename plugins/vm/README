===============================================================================
This is the code for the latest revisions to the third version of Little 
Smalltalk. The source tree has been reorganized a bit, the Makefile is simpler, 
and the source has been adapted to work on modern Unix-like OSes such as Linux.

Development is sporadic, but ongoing. I hope to continue working on this for 
years to come, keeping it as small, simple, and elegant as possible.

As with the original version of LST3, you can use this code freely and without 
restriction of any kind. This is public domain, as granted by the original 
author, Tim Budd.
